## Vodville

Videos are generally treated as second-class content on Twitch, so it's impossible to ask questions like "has X streamer played Y before?"
This project was intended to fill in that lack by acting as a search engine for [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) videos.
Unfortunately, even when using the API it's not possible to get the games a specific user has played. 
To implement the functionality I'd want, the project would end up being more of a scraper than a search interface, and that's less interesting to me.

This project is now dormant, and will remain so until either the Twitch API is changed, or I need to use the OAuth code for something else.
